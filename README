Metacheck - everything besides spellchecking
============================================

* About

Metacheck is a Python program that can analyze your prose or poetry, it analyzes the text and looks for sentence length, word occurrence, word distance and more. It parses a text in an automated way such that after reading your manuscript a hundred times, you can still find those nasty errors.

* Features

Metacheck currently checks for:

- word occurrence analysis, i.e. a word histogram (using --cutoff)
- words close together (see --mindist & --minlen)
- word groups recurring, i.e. double sentences (see --groupsize, --grpsentence)

* Help

run ./metacheck -h to get info on the command line options
